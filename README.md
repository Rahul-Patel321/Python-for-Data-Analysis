# Python-for-Data-Exploration-and-Analysis

I have created this repository to include all the hands-on projects that i have performed while learning the detail study
of python for exploration and data analysis.
We shall look at various exploratory data analysis methods like: 
 

* Descriptive Statistics, which is a way of giving a brief overview of the dataset we are dealing with, including some measures and features of the sample
* Grouping data
* ANOVA, Analysis Of Variance, which is a computational method to divide variations in an observations set into different components.
* Correlation and correlation methods
